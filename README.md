# EventBridge for Godot 4

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy_it_here-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=itchdotio&label=itch.io&labelColor=black)](https://auteddy.itch.io)

**EventBridge** is a lightweight event-driven communication system for Godot 4 that supports:
- **Local and networked events**
- **Signal-based architecture**
- **Automatic JSON event registry**
- **Persistent namespace caching**
- **Duplicate-connection prevention**
- **Easy cleanup with `off_all()`**

Perfect for **multiplayer games** where you need structured, reusable events.

---

## âœ… Features
- **Namespaces** to group related events.
- Event actions:
  - `on(event_name, callable)` â†’ Subscribe
  - `emit(event_name, args)` â†’ Emit locally
  - `remote(event_name, args)` â†’ Emit to server
  - `to_all(event_name, args)` â†’ Emit to all peers
  - `only_me(event_name, args)` â†’ Emit only on local client
  - `to_id(peer_id, event_name, args)` â†’ Emit to a specific peer
- **Offload event cleanup** with `off_all()`
- Editor plugin for managing event registry (`event_registry.json`)

---

## âœ… Installation
1. Copy the **`addons/event_bridge`** folder into your Godot project.
2. Enable the **EventBridge** plugin in **Project Settings â†’ Plugins**.
3. Add **`event_bus.gd`** as an Autoload Singleton:
   - Name: `EventBridge`
   - Path: `res://addons/event_bridge/event_bus.gd`

---

## âœ… Example Event Registry (`event_registry.json`)
```json
{
	"Test": [
		{
			"name": "ping",
			"rpc": "remote",
			"args": ["msg"]
		},
		{
			"name": "pong",
			"rpc": "remote",
			"args": ["msg"]
		}
	]
}
```

---

## âœ… Usage

### 1. Get a Namespace
```gdscript
var ns = EventBridge.get_namespace("Test")
```

### 2. Subscribe to Events
```gdscript
ns.on("ping", func(msg):
	print("[CLIENT] PING received: %s" % msg)
	ns.remote("pong", ["Hello back from CLIENT %d" % multiplayer.get_unique_id()])
)
```

### 3. Emit Events (Server Example)
```gdscript
if multiplayer.is_server():
	await get_tree().create_timer(2.0).timeout
	ns.to_all("ping", ["Hello from SERVER"])
```

---

## âœ… Cleanup
When a node is removed, disconnect all its event handlers:
```gdscript
func _exit_tree():
	ns.off_all()
```

---

## âœ… Full API
| Method                | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `get_namespace(name)`| Returns Namespace object for a category         |
| `on(event, callable)`| Subscribe to an event                          |
| `emit(event, args)`  | Emit locally                                   |
| `remote(event, args)`| Emit to server                                 |
| `to_all(event, args)`| Emit to all peers                              |
| `only_me(event, args)`| Emit only on this client                      |
| `to_id(id, event, args)`| Emit to specific peer                       |
| `off_all()`          | Remove all handlers in this namespace          |

---

## âœ… Internal Structure
- **Signals are dynamically registered** based on the event registry.
- **Namespace caching** avoids creating duplicates.
- **Connected handler tracking** ensures no duplicate signal connections.

---

## âœ… Example Output
```
[EventBridge] Loaded registry from: res://addons/event_bridge/event_registry.json
[EventBridge] EventBus initialized with namespaces: ["Test"]
[EventBridge] Connected handler for Test::ping
[EventBridge] Connected handler for Test::pong
[EventBridge] Emit to all: Test::ping ["Hello from SERVER"]
[EventBridge] RPC received: Test::ping ["Hello from SERVER"]
[CLIENT] PING received: Hello from SERVER
[SERVER] PONG received from client: Hello back from CLIENT 123456789
```
